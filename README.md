_Object-oriented programming (OOP)_ is a programming paradigm that designs applications and computer programs using objects and their interactions.
It is built around the concept of "objects," which are data structures that contain both data and methods. These methods perform operations on the data and can also interact with other objects. The terms "static," "protected," and "private" are used in object-oriented programming to define the accessibility or level of visibility of a class's methods and properties.

A _Static Method_ or property is unique to the class and can be accessed without the need to create an instance of the class. This means that instead of creating an object of the class to access a static method or property, you can use the class name directly. A _Protected Method_ or property is accessible both within the class and by subclasses that inherit from it. This means that if a class has a protected method or property, any subclass of that class can access that method or property. A _Private Method_ or property is only accessible within the class. This means that no other classes, including subclasses, are permitted to access the private method or property. In general, it's best to make a method or property private if it's an implementation detail that other classes don't need to know about, and protected if subclasses need to use or override it.
