**Abstraction** is the process of hiding implementation details and displaying only the essential features of an object. In TypeScript, you can achieve abstraction by creating an abstract class with abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, and any class that extends an abstract class must implement its abstract methods.
